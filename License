This master license for the Lightman Trust Group (LTG) brand that is intentionally silent on any specific operational platform, thereby legally separating them. The license protects the LTG brand while explicitly stating that its use does not grant rights to, or imply endorsement of, any separate services offered by other entities, even if they maybe or are not within the Lightman Trust corporate ecosystem.


Lightman Trust Group Intellectual Property License Agreement

Effective Date:20th September 2025
Licensor:Lightman Trust Group ("LTG")
Licensee:[User/Company Name], ("You" or "Licensee")

1. Definitions

1.1. "Licensed IP" refers solely to the intellectual property of Lightman Trust Group made available for use under this agreement, including but not limited to:
    *   Brand Names:"Lightman Trust Group," its holding companies, and its affiliate trade names.
    *   Logos & Trademarks:All graphical logos, service marks, and trademarks owned by and directly associated with the LTG brand.
    *   Proprietary Content:Whitepapers, research reports, analytical frameworks, and methodologies developed and published under the LTG brand.

1.2. "Operational Platforms" refers to any distinct software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings, digital platforms, analytical tools, or technology services that operate under their own brand identity and terms, even if they are offered by entities within the broader corporate family of LTG. The Licensed IP explicitly excludes all intellectual property associated with these Operational Platforms.

1.3. "Purpose" refers to the limited, specific reason for which the LTG Licensed IP is granted, as explicitly described in an associated Order Form or written agreement...

2. Grant of License

2.3. Exclusion of Platform IP: This license grants rights only to the LTG Licensed IP as defined in Section 1.1. It explicitly does not grant any license, right, or permission to use the intellectual property, trademarks, trade dress, or content of any Operational Platforms (as defined in 1.2). Access to and use of any Operational Platform is governed exclusively by its own separate legal terms and conditions.

4. Ownership and Protection

4.4. Reservation of All Other Rights: LTG is the sole owner of the Licensed IP. All other intellectual property not explicitly defined herein as "Licensed IP," including but not limited to the technology, software, interfaces, and outputs of any Operational Platforms, is expressly excluded from this license and remains the sole property of LTG or its respective subsidiary entities. The use of LTG Licensed IP does not indicate ownership of, or endorsement by, any specific Operational Platform.

8. Disclaimer of Warranties & Limitation of Liability

8.3. Disclaimer for Other Services: Lightman Trust Group provides the Licensed IP "AS IS." LTG expressly disclaims all liability related to the performance, functionality, or outputs of any Operational Platforms. Any services provided by other entities within the corporate ecosystem are offered under their own operational licenses, rules, and disclaimers. Your use of any such service is at your own risk and subject to its own legal terms, and LTG shall not be held liable in relation thereto.

9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless LTG, its officers, directors, and employees from and against any and all claims... arising out of your breach of this agreement or your misuse of the LTG Licensed IP in connection with any service or product not explicitly authorized by LTG.

12. Corporate Structure and Separate Agreements

12.1. Distinct Operational Entities. Licensee acknowledges that Lightman Trust Group is a holding brand and that various services and technologies are developed and offered by distinct operational entities and platforms within its ecosystem.

12.2. Autonomous Terms of Other Services. Any service, platform, or tool offered by an LTG entity that is not explicitly the "Licensed IP" under this agreement operates under its own strictly separate legal terms and conditions. A license under this agreement does not constitute a license to use, access, or imply endorsement from any other service within the broader corporate family.

12.3. No Implied License. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to grant any right or license to any other intellectual property owned by LTG or its subsidiaries beyond the "Licensed IP," nor to grant any access to or rights in any SaaS offering, API, or technology platform.

Why This Approach is Legally Robust:

1. Complete Brand Separation: The LTG brand is protected under its own clean, standalone agreement.
2. Clear Scoping: By defining what is included ("Licensed IP") and what is categorically excluded ("Operational Platforms"), it removes ambiguity.
3. Risk Mitigation: It legally isolates the parent brand (LTG) from the operational risks and liabilities of its subsidiary platforms. A problem with a platform does not automatically become a problem with the core LTG brand under this license.
4. Flexibility: LTG can launch, acquire, or sunset various platforms (like Soloist.ai or others) without ever having to amend this core brand license agreement. Each platform operates under its own terms.
5. Prevents "Bundling" Claims: It prevents a third party from claiming that a license to use the LTG name on a marketing document also gives them the right to use, reference, or claim association with a specific technology platform.
