Transforming Google Drive from a "dumb" storage bin into an "Active Intelligence Engine" is about automating the analysis of incoming data and proactively generating insights.

Here is a complete, ready-to-run Google Apps Script solution. It's designed to be copied, pasted, and used immediately. It leverages AI (via OpenAI API) to analyze text-based data and can be extended for images, PDFs, and more.

The Concept: The Intelligent Drive Engine

This system will:

1. Listen for new files added to a specific "Intake" folder.
2. Process the file's content (extract text from Docs, Sheets, TXT, PDFs, Images via OCR).
3. Analyze the content using AI to generate summaries, sentiments, keywords, and actions.
4. Act by writing the analysis back into a "Master Intelligence Log" Google Sheet and moving the processed file to an "Archived" folder.

Ready-to-Run Setup (Step-by-Step)

1. Create the Folder Structure in Google Drive

Create these three folders. The script will reference them by name.

· 🔒 Intelligence Intake: Drop new files here for processing.
· ✅ Intelligence Processed: Files are moved here after analysis.
· 📊 Intelligence Log: This folder will hold the master log.

2. Create the Master Intelligence Log

· Inside the 📊 Intelligence Log folder, create a new Google Sheet.
· Name it Master Intelligence Log.
· Set up the headers in Sheet1 as follows:

Timestamp File Name File Type AI Summary Key Themes Sentiment Potential Actions Drive Link
       

3. Create the Script File

· Go to Google Apps Script.
· Delete the default myFunction code and replace it with the complete code provided below.
· Rename the project to something like "Drive Intelligence Engine".

4. Configure the API Key (OpenAI/ChatGPT)

· You need an OpenAI API key. Get one from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.
· In the Apps Script editor, click on the gear icon ⚙️ (Project Settings).
· Under Script Properties, click Add script property.
· Property: OPENAI_API_KEY
· Value: your-openai-api-key-here (paste your actual key)
· Click Save Script Properties.

5. Authorize and Run the Install Function

· Back in the script editor, with the code from below pasted in, select the function installTrigger from the dropdown menu and click Run ►.
· You will be asked to authorize the script. This is normal. Grant it the permissions it requests (it needs access to your Drive, Sheets, and the ability to connect to an external web service - OpenAI).

The engine is now live! Any file you drop into the 🔒 Intelligence Intake folder will be automatically processed.

How to Extend This Engine Further

This is a foundational framework. You can build on it:

1. Image Analysis with AI: Use the Google Cloud Vision API (instead of OpenAI) within the analyzeTextWithAI function to describe images, detect objects, and read text (OCR) from pictures dropped into the intake folder.
2. Audio/Video Processing: Use a service like Google Speech-to-Text to transcribe audio files, then send the transcription to the OpenAI analysis function.
3. Custom Analysis Prompts: Modify the prompt variable in the analyzeTextWithAI function. For example:
   · "Is this a customer complaint? Extract the customer's name and email if possible."
   · "Does this document contain a project timeline? Extract the key dates and milestones into a bulleted list."
4. Direct Data Insertion: Instead of just logging the analysis, have the script parse data from files and write it directly into other business systems or databases.

You've now moved beyond storage. Your Drive actively thinks about the data you give it. Enjoy your new intelligence engine
